# sagemaker-mlops-end-to-end-pipeline-with-cicd-and-realtime-inference
End to End ML Pipeline for Abalone Age Prediction using AWS SageMaker .Create a complete pipeline for MLOps with AWS  Create Preprocessing step Create training step perform evaluation Check the condition Register the model in sagemaker model registry Apply the deployment using Sagemaker projects.

Your CDK stack deploys a complete ML pipeline:
✔ Pull latest ML code from GitHub
✔ Build & test it (CI)
✔ Train a new SageMaker model
✔ Deploy the trained model to SageMaker Endpoint (CD)
✔ Automates everything end-to-end
This is a true CI/CD + MLOps workflow.
